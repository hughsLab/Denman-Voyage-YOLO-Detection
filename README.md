Object detection on board the RSV Nuyina during the Denman voyage

This was a bit of fun I had conducting some object detection on Antarctic creatures. 
The idea was to capture creatures of the wild as we passed them, identify them, then log the captures to a file. 
It did not work out this way due to CCTV zoom capability and no control being a non-invasive coding project.
So the project rendered the results as seen below, still fun. 
You can just make out myself on the heli deck!
